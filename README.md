### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Tanveer Efty!

âœ¨ Iâ€™m an aspiring full stack developer/software engineer, and illustrator with a passion for blending creativity and technology. Since a very young age, I loved watching YouTube videos that dug into the technical side of video gamesâ€”explaining how they were coded and the creative shortcuts taken to maintain quality, I've always admired 2D art from games to TV shows and the origin of their inspiration. That early curiosity sparked my love for both coding and art, and itâ€™s what continues to drive me today. My goal is to create meaningful projects that unite technical precision with creative expression. âœ¨
